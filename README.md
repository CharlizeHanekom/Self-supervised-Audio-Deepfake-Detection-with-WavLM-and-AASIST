## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Under Active Development** ðŸš§  
This project is currently in development (February - October 2025 timeline). Implementation and evaluation phases are ongoing.

## Overview
This research project develops a **hybrid deep learning system** for detecting audio deepfakes by combining:
- **WavLM** (self-supervised speech representation model)
- **AASIST** (spectro-temporal graph attention network)
- **FCNN classifier** (fully connected neural network)

### Key Objectives:
1. **Improve generalization** across diverse deepfake generation methods (TTS/VC/replay attacks)
2. **Reduce dependency** on labeled training data via self-supervised learning
3. **Enhance robustness** against real-world audio conditions (noise, compression, etc.)

### Technical Approach:
- Leverages WavLM's ability to capture both low-level acoustic artifacts and high-level semantic patterns
- Utilizes AASIST's attention mechanisms to analyze spectral-temporal relationships
- Implements data augmentation techniques (noise injection, reverberation) for improved robustness
- Evaluates on multiple benchmarks (ASVspoof, In-The-Wild, ADD datasets)

*Academic project for COS700 at University of Pretoria (Feb-Oct 2025)*
